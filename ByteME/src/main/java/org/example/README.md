## Assumptions
### 1. The GUI is implemented in the Main file (ByteMe).
### 2. All customers and the admin can see the GUI menu and pending orders from their CLI Menu by the choice "1a".
### 3. All customers can see all pending orders in order to have an idea of how much longer before their order, Similar to how some restaurants display all the pending orders on a screen.
### 4. There is no functionality for sign up as it was deemed optional in both assignments. There are 4 customers already added, their details can be seen in seedData() function in ByteMe file.
### 5. I have opted for Save order histories and Cart storage in I/O stream management, and Out of stock and Cart operations in JUnit Testing.
### 6. I have used json files to store data as required in the I/O stream management portion of the assignment.
### 7. Customers are assumed to have infinite money.
